# Blue Glockenspiel
Blue Glockenspiel is the first sample instrument produced and released by Vörös Music. It is based on a small toy glockenspiel, recorded at a medium-close distance with ORTF-miking, for a mixture of intimacy and sound. The instrument has good dynamics and character for a use in multiple generes. The added features of reverb and saturation are supposed to help the user concept and compose.

This repository contains the HISE project, scripts, and image files for the Vörös Music "Blue Glockenspiel" virtual sample instrument.

All of scripts contained in this project are released under the GPL v3 license, or a GPL compatible license (see License.txt for details).

If you want use this for your own project I would wish you'd change the UI to create a clear distinktion between yours and this release!
